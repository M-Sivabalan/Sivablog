								<h3>ARDUINO BASED INTELLIGENT WALKING VOICE
									ASSISTANCE STICK FOR PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED
									PERSONS</h3>
                                 <p>This
									device will be best solution to overcome their difficulties. Blindness is a state of
									lacking the visual perception due to physiological or neurological factors. The
									partial blindness represents the lack of integration in the growth of the optic
									nerve or visual center of the eye and total blindness is the full absence of the
									visual light perception. Imagine walking into an unfamiliar place. One has to
									ask for guidance in order to reach to the destination. But what if the person is
									visually impaired!! Person has to completely depend on other people to reach
									destination. Generally we observe that white cane is the best friend of visually
									impaired person.</p>

							<h3>Exlaw Cursore</h3>
							<p>"This project was completed with the help of Python and machine learning techniques. The project involved the detection of hand gestures and its implementation as a virtual mouse method on a monitor. Additionally, a live chatbot was added using AI. The aim was to enable communication with the help of hand language, using text messages to the user. In order to achieve this, we had to learn hand language."</p>
							<h3>Class Mangement</h3>
							<p>"The name of the project is 'Class Management'. The purpose of this project is to help students maintain their exam-related details, such as resumes, updates, and mark entries from platforms like Codechef, Leetcode, etc. This system will act as a portal, similar to the way such websites maintain student records, and will assist staff in filtering and accessing student information."</p>
                            <h3>Blog</h3>
